## Lime Explainer Demo

This is a simple Shiny App, implementing an example about LIME by [Christoph Molnar](https://github.com/christophM) in his book [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html). All the code is orginally by Christoph Molnar with few modifications in the [lime_explainer App](https://github.com/OmaymaS/lime_explainer/tree/master/lime_explainer_shiny) as well as [lime_explaier_script](https://github.com/OmaymaS/lime_explainer/blob/master/R/lime_explainer_script.R).
